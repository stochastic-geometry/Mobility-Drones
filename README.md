# Performance Characterization of Canonical Mobility Models in Drone Cellular Networks

## MATLAB scripts and functions.

### Authors: Morteza Banagar and Harpreet S. Dhillon

### Emails: mbanagar@vt.edu and hdhillon@vt.edu

This repository contains matlab codes for the simulations in [1]. In each folder, you will find the required codes (and data if applicable) to recreate all simulation plots provided in [1]. For analytical evaluations, Monte-Carlo (MC) integration has been used.

Please cite [1] for reusing these codes and contact Morteza Banagar at mbanagar@vt.edu if you have any questions.

Parts of [1] was presented at the 2019 IEEE Globecom in Waikoloa, HI, USA [2], [3]. The repository for the codes of [2] and [3] can be found [here](https://github.com/stochastic-geometry/3GPP-Mobility-Drone) and [here](https://github.com/stochastic-geometry/SRWP-Drones), respectively.
